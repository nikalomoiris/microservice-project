# microservices-project

This project is a monorepo for a collection of microservices. It includes services for managing products, inventory, reviews, orders, and centralized logging.

## Modules

This project contains the following microservices:

*   **product-service:** Manages products and categories with support for filtering and sorting.
*   **inventory-service:** Manages product inventory with stock reservation and release capabilities.
*   **review-service:** Manages product reviews with upvote/downvote functionality.
*   **order-service:** Manages customer orders with integration to inventory service.
*   **logging-service:** Centralized logging service that consumes logs from Kafka.
*   **logging-client:** Library module for publishing logs to Kafka from other services.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

*   Java 17
*   Maven
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

## Building the Project

To build the entire project, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Running the Services

To run the services, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:
*   `postgres-service` on port `5432` (PostgreSQL database)
*   `rabbitmq-service` on ports `5672` (AMQP) and `15672` (Management UI)
*   `zookeeper-service` on port `2181` (Kafka coordination)
*   `kafka-service` on port `9092` (Message broker)
*   `product-service` on port `8080`
*   `order-service` on port `8081`
*   `review-service` on port `8082`
*   `inventory-service` on port `8083`
*   `logging-service` on port `8090`

## API Endpoints and cURL Commands

            "quantity": 2
        }
    ]
}' http://localhost:8081/api/orders
```

### Logging Service

The logging service consumes log messages from a Kafka topic (`service-logs`) and outputs them to the console. It runs on port `8090` but does not expose HTTP endpoints. Services can publish logs using the `logging-client` library.

## Infrastructure Components

The project uses the following infrastructure services:

*   **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent storage (port `5432`)
*   **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication between services
    *   AMQP port: `5672`
    *   Management UI: `http://localhost:15672` (username: `guest`, password: `guest`)
*   **Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform for logging (port `9092`)
*   **Zookeeper**: Coordination service for Kafka (port `2181`)
