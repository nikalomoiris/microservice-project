# RabbitMQ Message Flow â€” microservices-project

This file contains a Mermaid diagram for the RabbitMQ message flow between services, plus a short mapping and payload notes.

## Sequence diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Product as product-service
    participant Rabbit as rabbitmq (exchanges)
    participant Inventory as inventory-service
    participant Order as order-service

    Note over Product,Rabbit: product-service publishes to product-exchange (routing key "product.created")
    Product->>Rabbit: publish to exchange "product-exchange" (routing key = "product.created")\nPayload: ProductCreatedEvent { sku: "LP123", ... }

    Note over Order,Rabbit: order-service publishes to order-exchange (routing key "order.created")
    Order->>Rabbit: publish to exchange "order-exchange" (routing key = "order.created")\nPayload: OrderPlacedEvent { orderId: "...", lineItems: [...] }

    Note over Rabbit,Inventory: inventory-service queues bound
    Rabbit->>Inventory: deliver to queue "inventory-service-queue" (bound to product-exchange with "product.created")\n-> inventory-service handleProductCreated(ProductCreatedEvent)
    Rabbit->>Inventory: deliver to queue "order.created.inventory.queue" (bound to order-exchange with "order.created")\n-> inventory-service handleOrderCreated(OrderEvent)
```

## Topology (graph)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ProductExchange [product-exchange]
    PE(exchange)
  end

  subgraph OrderExchange [order-exchange]
    OE(exchange2)
  end

  PE -->|product.created| InventoryQueue[inventory-service-queue]
  OE -->|order.created| OrderInventoryQueue[order.created.inventory.queue]

  ProductService[product-service] -->|publish product.created| PE
  OrderService[order-service] -->|publish order.created| OE
  InventoryService[inventory-service] -->|consume| InventoryQueue
  InventoryService -->|consume| OrderInventoryQueue
```

## Component mapping (exact names from code)

- product-service
  - Exchange: `product-exchange`
  - Routing key: `product.created`
  - Producer: `ProductService.createProduct(...)` calls `rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("product-exchange", "product.created", savedProduct.getSku())`

- order-service
  - Exchange: `order-exchange`
  - Routing key: `order.created`
  - Producer: `OrderService.createOrder(...)` calls `rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("order-exchange", "order.created", event)`

- inventory-service
  - Listens for product-created
    - Queue: `inventory-service-queue` bound to `product-exchange` with `product.created`
    - Consumer: `ProductEventListener.handleProductCreatedEvent(ProductCreatedEvent)`
  - Listens for order-created
    - Queue: `order.created.inventory.queue` bound to `order-exchange` with `order.created`
    - Consumer: `OrderEventListener.handleOrderCreatedEvent(OrderEvent)`

## Payload compatibility notes

- product-service publishes the SKU (string) in the current `ProductService` implementation, while the inventory consumer expects a `ProductCreatedEvent` DTO. Verify that a JSON message converter is used and that producers produce compatible JSON shapes (or adjust producers/consumers).

- order-service publishes an `OrderPlacedEvent`; inventory expects an `OrderEvent` (shapes appear compatible but confirm fields and converter usage).

## How to view

- Open this file in VS Code and use a Mermaid preview extension (or paste the Mermaid blocks into https://mermaid.live/) to render diagrams.

## Next steps

- If you want I can:
  - (A) Confirm DTO class fields (`ProductCreatedEvent`, `OrderPlacedEvent`, `OrderEvent`) for exact compatibility.
  - (B) Add a small README excerpt showing how to run the docker-compose stack so the RabbitMQ topology appears.
  - (C) Export the diagram to PNG/SVG (requires local Mermaid CLI or remote renderer).
